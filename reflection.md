What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think unit testing seems really helpful, and it mostly isn't too confusing. It takes a little extra work, but probably once the code that we're doing is more difficult to debug, it will make the extra effort worth it. Working off of examples from class was really helpful, as well as working with a classmate (thanks Tanisha Chetty). Some of the specific tests asked for in the rubric/readme, however, were really confusing to me which was difficult. I also was super busy this past week so I had to get an extension and also was unable to attend any TA/office hours to get help on this, which probably would have been helpful.
